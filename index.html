                <p>The school has 14 clubs and youth groups which organize activities for their members. The Boy Scouts is open to all students, while membership in the other clubs is open to students of Class 9 and above. Every club has a special "Club Week" where it organises various club-related events for students of all classes. These events include debates, quizzes, science exhibitions, sports tournaments and singing and dance competitions. Each club also handles the organisation and management of several events in "Boscotsav", the annual school fest. Sports available at the school include cricket, basketball, cricket, football, volleyball, table tennis, and karate, with coaching facilities for the first three. The football team competes against other local schools and at district-level. The school team won the District Championship organized by TTIS in 2010 and the Savio Cup organized by Don Bosco School Park Circus in the same year.

Other extra-curricular activities include: a quiz team, which competes with local schools and in citywide competitions; a chess team, which participates in state-level and inter-school level competitions; and a debating team, which finished as National runners up in the 2008 "Debating Matters India" conducted by the British Council[11] and the Institute of Ideas.[12] The school's Model United Nations team won the top award of Best Delegation along with several other awards at LMCMUN 2009, organised by La Martiniere Calcutta in association with the West Bengal Federation of the United Nations Association, the first ever Model United Nations organised in Eastern India. The school's annual magazine, The Canvas, is a collection of sketches, prose, poetry and accounts, created by the students.
